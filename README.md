# Online Book Store
This is a **simple console-based Online Book Store** developed in C++ for beginner programmers. The project allows users to view available books, search books by ID or name, add books to a shopping cart, remove items, and calculate the total bill. It demonstrates the use of basic C++ concepts such as loops, conditional statements, switch-case, functions, structures, and arrays.

## Features
* Display all available books with details (ID, Name, Author, Price, Stock)
* Search books by ID or Name
* Add books to a shopping cart
* Remove books from the cart
* View cart items
* Calculate and display the total bill
* Simple menu-driven interface

## Tools and Technologies
* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Platform:** Console-based application
* **Compiler/IDE:** Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or any C++ compiler
* **Operating System:** Windows

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or compiler.
3. Compile the code.
4. Run the executable file.
5. Follow the menu to view books, add to cart, and generate the bill.

## Concepts Used
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)
* Switch-case statements
* Functions for modular programming
* Structures for organizing book and cart data
* Arrays to store books and cart items

## Future Enhancements
* Add file handling to save book and cart data
* Implement user login system
* Create admin panel for adding/updating books
* Integrate online payment simulation

If you want, I can also **create a short, visually formatted version** with **badges, table of contents, and screenshots** to make it look **professional on GitHub**.

Do you want me to do that?
