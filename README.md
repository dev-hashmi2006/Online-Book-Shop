# Online-Book-Shop
A simple console-based Online Book Store developed in C++ for beginner programmers. The project allows users to view available books, search books by ID or name, add books to a shopping cart, remove items, and calculate the total bill. This project demonstrates the use of basic C++ concepts such as loops, switchs, functions, structures, and arrays.
